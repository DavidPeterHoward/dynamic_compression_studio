## ❓ WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU

### Critical Questions

1. **Are our 21 "critical" gaps actually critical?**
   - We suspect 4-6 might be downgraded to HIGH
   - Need your independent assessment

2. **Did we miss any major gaps?**
   - Apply your own analysis
   - Identify blind spots

3. **Are quality scores realistic?**
   - Before: 7.2/10
   - After (projected): 9.0/10
   - Achievable?

4. **Is our 6-week action plan executable?**
   - Timeline realistic?
   - Resource estimates accurate?

5. **Are calculations correct?**
   - 48 person-weeks effort
   - $144k cost estimate
   - ROI justification

## 🔴 TOP 3 ISSUES WE FOUND (Validate These)

**Issue 1: Missing Gap Validation Checklist**
- Problem: No way to verify gap completion
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Your assessment: Is this truly critical?

**Issue 2: Modal Verb Ambiguity (MUST vs SHOULD)**
- Problem: 89 "should" statements, many should be "MUST"
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Your assessment: Did we classify correctly?

**Issue 3: Incomplete Process Specifications**
- Problem: Implementation workflows not step-by-step
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Your assessment: Are proposed workflows sufficient?

## 🎯 FOCUS AREAS (Where We're Most Uncertain)

1. **Priority Classification** - Are 21 gaps truly CRITICAL?
2. **Quality Projections** - Is 9.0/10 achievable?
3. **Effort Estimates** - Are they realistic?
4. **Completeness** - What did we miss?
5. **Feasibility** - Can this be done in 6 weeks?

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Your review is complete when you can answer:**
- [ ] Are findings valid? (Yes/Mostly/Partially/No)
- [ ] What did they miss? (List 3-10 items)
- [ ] What should change? (Specific corrections)
- [ ] What's the priority? (Confirm or revise)
