## WHAT WE'RE MOST UNCERTAIN ABOUT

### Areas Where We Need Your Validation Most

**1. Priority Classification** (HIGH UNCERTAINTY)
- Are our 21 "critical" gaps truly all critical?
- Suspect 4-6 might be HIGH instead of CRITICAL
- Need independent judgment on: Gaps 11, 14, 15, 18, 20

**2. Quality Score Projections** (MEDIUM UNCERTAINTY)
- Is 9.0/10 achievable with proposed corrections?
- Before scores subjective (7.2/10 overall)
- After scores are projections, not measured

**3. Effort Estimates** (MEDIUM UNCERTAINTY)
- Are 1-3 week estimates per gap realistic?
- Do they include adequate buffer?
- Testing time sufficient?

**4. Completeness** (HIGH UNCERTAINTY)
- Did we miss major gaps?
- Is 7-dimension analysis sufficient?
- What blind spots might we have?

**5. Action Plan Feasibility** (MEDIUM UNCERTAINTY)
- Is 6 weeks realistic for all corrections?
- Are resource requirements accurate?
- Dependencies properly identified?

**Please focus extra attention on these uncertain areas.**

## EXPECTED ISSUES YOU MIGHT FIND

### Based on Limitations of Our Review

**Possible False Positives:**
- Some "critical" gaps might not be truly critical
- Some issues might be stylistic preferences not real problems
- Over-specification in some areas

**Possible False Negatives:**
- Missed gaps in dimensions we didn't analyze (security, performance)
- Blind spots from single reviewer bias
- Technical issues in specialized domains

**Possible Calculation Errors:**
- Effort estimates might be too optimistic
- Quality scores might be inflated
- Coverage percentages might be miscalculated

**Possible Methodology Issues:**
- 7 iterations might be arbitrary (why not 6 or 8?)
- Time allocation might be inappropriate
- Priorities might reflect reviewer bias

**We expect you to find 10-20 issues with our work. If you find fewer, you might not be being critical enough. If you find 50+, we might have fundamental problems.**
