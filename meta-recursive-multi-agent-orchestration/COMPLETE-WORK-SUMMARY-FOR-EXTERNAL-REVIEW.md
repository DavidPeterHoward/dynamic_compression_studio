## 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE ASKING EXTERNAL REVIEWER TO DO

### Core Mission

**Validate our work independently** by:
1. Reviewing findings critically
2. Identifying missed issues
3. Confirming or revising priorities
4. Assessing quality scores
5. Evaluating action plan feasibility

### Specific Questions for Them

**Critical Questions:**
1. Are all 21 "critical" gaps truly critical?
2. Did we miss any major gaps?
3. Are quality scores (7.2 → 9.0) realistic?
4. Is 6-week action plan executable?
5. Are effort estimates accurate?

**Detailed Questions:**
- Are mathematical calculations correct?
- Are logical analyses sound?
- Are priorities appropriate?
- Are corrections sufficient?
- What would they do differently?

### Expected Deliverables from Reviewer

**Required (5 documents):**
1. Validation Report - overall assessment
2. Critical Issues List - what needs immediate attention
3. Quality Assessment - independent scores
4. Gap Analysis - missed/disputed gaps
5. Action Plan Review - feasibility + revisions

**Optional but Valuable:**
6. Methodology critique
7. Meta-meta-review
8. Alternative approaches

## ⚠️ AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY

### Where We Need External Validation Most

**HIGH UNCERTAINTY:**
1. **Priority Classification**
   - Are all 21 gaps truly CRITICAL?
   - Suspect 4-6 should be HIGH instead
   - Need independent judgment

2. **Completeness**
   - Did we miss major gaps?
   - 7 dimensions sufficient?
   - Blind spots?

**MEDIUM UNCERTAINTY:**
3. **Quality Projections**
   - Is 9.0/10 achievable?
   - Are before scores accurate?

4. **Effort Estimates**
   - Are 1-3 weeks per gap realistic?
   - Adequate buffer included?

5. **Action Plan**
   - 6 weeks feasible?
   - Resources adequate?
   - Dependencies correct?
